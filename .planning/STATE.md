## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Deduplication (AI-05, AI-06) placed in Phase 4 instead of Phase 2 -- requires real analysis data to calibrate similarity thresholds effectively
- [Roadmap]: 4 phases following strict dependency chain (Foundation -> AI -> GitHub -> Intelligence) validated by research

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Supabase webhook payload schema must be confirmed before Phase 1 webhook parsing is implemented
- githubkit viability should be verified (active maintenance, async API coverage) before Phase 3
